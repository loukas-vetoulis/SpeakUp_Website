            <p>How do you sell a startup idea in under 60 seconds? In our third event, SpeakUP joined forces with the UniStudents team to master the art of the Elevator Pitch.</p>
            <p>We moved beyond theory with two practical pitching simulations where participants had to pitch a startup concept under time pressure.</p>
            <p>Under the guidance of <strong>Nikos Sklavounos</strong> (Founder) and <strong>Angelos Kleniatis</strong> (Partnerships Manager), students learned to distill complex business ideas into clear, persuasive hooks.</p>
            <p>The session focused on the "how-to" of professional delivery, providing everyone with personalized feedback and the confidence to present their goals in any high-stakes environment.</p>

            <p>Communication isn't just about how you speak to others; it’s about the internal dialogue you have with yourself.</p>
            <p>For this SpeakUP event, <strong>Konstantinos Kintzios</strong> (Business Mentor) joined us for an honest conversation on personal evolution and discipline. Rather than a traditional lecture, the evening was a deep dive into the habits that bridge the gap between who we are and who we want to become.</p>
            <p>The energy was electric as students shared their own journeys and connected over the shared goal of long-term self-investment.</p>
